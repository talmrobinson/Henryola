                                                             Henryola is an a free web application that assists those with an UCSC email address in scheduling private study rooms at the Mchenry Library.  Henryola makes the tedious process of obtaining room appoints easy and lets you spend more time with your studies.  

                                                                     The Mchenry has their own site for booking rooms but it requires that you check the availability of each room <i>individually</i> per day.  Furthermore, come time book, one may only book one room at a time.  Henryola gives you a broad view of both the entire week and all of the rooms on every floor.

Browse and select the rooms  and times you’d like to have booked.  The rooms staged to be booked for you will turn dark blue. If you see only gray squares on all rooms, then there were no available times that worked with your preferences.  When you have your desired rooms selected click book.

We used www.glitch.com to host our website.  Glitch is a free website that  lets you deploy web applications using NodeJs.  You are given a URL and a text editor that your whole team can edit in.  Projects can be previewed and then pushed to git.  Glitch had a tutorial book called “The Node Beginner Book” by Manuel Kiessling https://node-beginner.glitch.me.  We used this book as a framework for setting up our index.js and router. Node.js As our Javascript framework for handling server side programming.

In the case of Henryola, the entire application is run in the browser from the single index URL, therefore our index is responsible for all the html in which the user will enter information and it calls the files/functions to stylize the page such as multistep.js,style.css, and the calendar canvas from UI.js.  The design is heavily influenced by the Designify tutorial on single page  multistep development https://codepen.io/designify-me/pen/qrJWpG.
